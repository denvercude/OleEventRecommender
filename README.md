Olé – Proposal for AI‑Driven Campus Event Discovery

About the Proposal:  
This repository serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate product thinking: identifying a clear campus engagement gap and proposing an AI‑driven solution. It highlights my ability to analyze user needs, design a matching algorithm, and communicate a compelling vision via video and mockups.

Introduction:  
At many universities, students struggle to discover relevant campus events that match their interests. Without personalized recommendations, low-attendance events go unnoticed and students miss valuable opportunities.

Identified Problem:  
Information overload: Hundreds of events each semester overwhelm students.
Lack of personalization: No tailored suggestions based on a student’s profile or past interests.
Missed engagement: Organizers see low turnout; students miss out on community-building activities.

Proposed Solution:  
Olé leverages text‑based user profiles and event descriptions to generate personalized event recommendations:
Convert user interests and event details into TF‑IDF vectors.
Compute cosine similarity to rank events by relevance.
Present a sorted list of high‑match events with filters and visual relevance scores.

Key Components:  
Interest Modeling: Extract keywords from student profiles or survey responses.
Event Encoding: Transform event descriptions into TF‑IDF representations.
Similarity Scoring: Use cosine similarity to measure alignment.
UI Mockups: Conceptual React-based interfaces displaying ranked events and filters.

Expected Impact:  
Increased attendance: More students discover events aligned with their interests.
Enhanced engagement: Better match quality fosters stronger campus community.
Data-driven insights: Organizers gain analytics on event relevance and student preferences.
